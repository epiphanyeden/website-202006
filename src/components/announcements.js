          <p>
            For at least 15 years, we have helped feed and shelter our homeless
            neighbors. Our church was one of the founding churches for the
            homeless shelter which is now run by Home of Refuge Outreach.
          </p>
          <p>
            This year we have given financial support to help with operational
            costs as well as for the new facility being developed.
          </p>
          <p>Now it is time for us to feed our neighbors.</p>
          <p>
            Our remaining dates are listed below. The date is when we are to
            supply dinner. We also bring breakfast for the following morning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because of COVID, we can drop food off at a table outside the
            shelter and the neighbors will bring it in and serve themselves.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.list}>
            You can help by doing one or more of the following:
            <li>Supply food for someone else to cook</li>
            <li>Cook or prepare food</li>
            <li>Deliver food to the shelter</li>
            <li>
              Buy supplies needed for that night- from drinks to bowls to paper
              towels
            </li>
            <li>Deliver supplies to the shelter</li>
          </p>
          <p>
            For dinner, we should provide a tasty, nutritious, and fully
            prepared meal. Some sort of dessert is real nice too.
          </p>
          <p>
            For breakfast, most days it is ok to supply something like
            bacon/sausage and eggs that the host can cook. Homemade breakfast
            casseroles and biscuits are also enjoyed. Breakfast can be dropped
            off in the evening.
          </p>
          <p>
            As we get closer to the date, we will find out how many neighbors to
            expect and what supplies we may need to bring.

            Starting June 15, adult Sunday School will be Tuesdays at 7 pm. We
            will meet for about 1 hour.
          </p>

            people.

            The format will remain the same: watch the National Cathedral sermon
            from the prior Sunday and discuss it.

          <p>
            It is very informal. It is not uncommon for the discussions to
            wander a bit, which is ok.
