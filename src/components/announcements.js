          <p>
            Starting June 15, adult Sunday School will be Tuesdays at 7 pm. We
            will meet for about 1 hour.
          </p>
          <p>
            We hope this change might make Sunday School available to more
            people.
          </p>
          <p>
            The format will remain the same: watch the National Cathedral sermon
            from the prior Sunday and discuss it.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is very informal. It is not uncommon for the discussions to
            wander a bit, which is ok.
          </p>
          <p>We hope you will join us.</p>
