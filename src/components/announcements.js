            Starting June 15, adult Sunday School will be Tuesdays at 7 pm. We
            will meet for about 1 hour.

            We hope this change might make Sunday School available to more
            people.

            The format will remain the same: watch the National Cathedral sermon
            from the prior Sunday and discuss it.
