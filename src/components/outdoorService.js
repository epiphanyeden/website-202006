            Below are the requirements which MUST be followed in order to join

              Ushers will be trained on all procedures. You must follow the

              exit procedures.

            <li>
              If you have any symptoms of Covid 19, or have been exposed to a
              person with Covid 19, please worship at home.
            </li>
            <li>
              Face coverings will be worn at all times while attending worship.
              These must cover the nose and mouth, and may not be lowered or
              removed until you return to your car. If you have a medical reason
              for not wearing a mask, please watch the service on our website or

              Social distancing must be practiced at all times, including before
              and after worship. Itâ€™ll be tempting to hug our friends and get

              maintained for anyone not permanently living in the same
              household.

              symptoms of and exposure to Covid-19. Social distancing will be
              maintained between worshippers during the sign-in period.
            </li>
            <li>
              The building will be locked and no one may enter before,during or

              If ushers have other requirements once you arrive, please follow
              their instructions.
